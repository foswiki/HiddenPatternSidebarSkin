# $VERSION is referred to by Foswiki, and is the only global variable that
# *must* exist in this package. This should always be in the format
# $Rev: 3193 $ so that Foswiki can determine the checked-in status of the
# extension.
our $VERSION = '$Rev$'; # version of *this file*.

# $RELEASE is used in the "Find More Extensions" automation in configure.
# It is a manually maintained string used to identify functionality steps.
# You can use any of the following formats:
# tuple   - a sequence of integers separated by . e.g. 1.2.3. The numbers
#           usually refer to major.minor.patch release or similar. You can
#           use as many numbers as you like e.g. '1' or '1.2.3.4.5'.
# isodate - a date in ISO8601 format e.g. 2009-08-07
# date    - a date in 1 Jun 2009 format. Three letter English month names only.
# Note: it's important that this string is exactly the same in the extension
# topic - if you use %$RELEASE% with BuildContrib this is done automatically.
